## ArduVR server handlers ##

Those 2 solutions are polling input from serial ports to driver ArduVR.    
When you launch them by hand, they will ash for serial port.    
To update them in KinecToVR folder, please rename left-hand ouput to avr_hhost.exe   
and right-hand output to avr_mhost.exe!    
Otherwise, K2VR will just crash or don't start servers for polling con's input.
