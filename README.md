# KinectToVR
An open-source hook for VRInputEmulator to enable foot and hip tracking with the Kinect.
It currently allows for the hips, left foot and right foot to be tracked with the skeletal positions from the Kinect. Their positions are updated to a virtual tracker from the OpenVR Input Emulator in order to translate it into VR games.

## Author's note
This was my first actual project and I've had a lot of 'fun' and fun getting it to work. I'm still learning C++ and programming concepts, so I feel that this has helped a great deal where reading from a book really can't. Thank you for being patient enough to read this all the way to the end and I hope my code is not too atrocious.

As always, feedback is appreciated so that I can learn and improve my skills.

Thanks, and have fun in VR!
