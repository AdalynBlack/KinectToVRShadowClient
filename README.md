# KinectToVR
KinectToVR is a synregic combination of head tracking (yes, it's free),
full body trackers and controllers support, that finally gives you software
to track your body that is free, won't crash and doesn't need some weird inputemulator to basic work.
(It still needs it, modified, for head tracking, if you like to do so)

## Getting Started - Users

## License
KinectToVR is based on GPL v3, so you need to follow it.     
Although, all changes that i made, go to CreativeCommons.    

## Changed so far:
* Calibration method - now it's even shorter than d4vr's one!
* Trackers implementation - K2 is now static openvr driver
* Head Tracking - yes, you can use this for tracking your head (AND NOT GET 'DIZZY')
* Controllers - ArduVR emulates index controllers with your arduino (more info at https://ovr.ayakimi.rf.gd)
* Icons of trackers - they're pucks, aren't they?
* Flip - kinect now works even if you are back to it
* Automatical spawn of trackers
* Automatical start of head tracking
* Auto start of controllers handle
* There is not need to have any controllers to calibration (you have, but it's only information)
* Synergic calibration - all at once (except when you're using head tracking)
* Deleted unused parts of program - psmoves and some weirdo stuff
* more and more..
